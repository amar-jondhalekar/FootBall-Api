### Explanation:
- **public/**: Contains any static assets that do not need to be processed by Vite.
- **src/**: Contains all source code, including components, services for API calls, and styling.
- **.eslintrc.cjs**: ESLint configuration for enforcing coding standards.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.
- **index.html**: The HTML file that serves as the entry point for the app.
- **package.json**: Manages dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration file for Vite, a fast frontend build tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A RapidAPI account with access to the Football API.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:amar-jondhalekar/FootBall-Api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd FootBall-Api
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up your API key from RapidAPI:
   - Create an `.env` file in the root of the project.
   - Add your Football API key:

    ```bash
    VITE_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Use the app to browse football leagues, teams, and player data.
- View live match scores and results.
- Search for specific football-related data using the app’s interface.

## Deployment

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized bundle of the application in the `dist/` directory, which you can deploy on any static hosting service.
